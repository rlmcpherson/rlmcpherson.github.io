        <p>As an all-grain home brewer, I'm always looking for ways to make my brewing process and my beer better. One way to improve process it to reduce the length of a brew day. All grain brewing takes hours and can easily consume an entire weekend day. I'm not obsessed with optimizing total brew time, though, but also the stressfulness and tedium of brewing. Among the most tedious of brewing activities is monitoring mash water temp as it heats. I recently built a simple solution to this problem that is both inexpensive and effective. Even if, like me, you are using a basic cooler-based mash tun and kettle setup, you already have most of the equipment you need. For about $100 (even less if you have some of the necessary equipment already) you can wake up to hot mash water and be mashed in within minutes of starting your brew day.</p>
